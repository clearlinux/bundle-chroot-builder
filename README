Configuration File
==================
Please update the configuration file paths to point to where your
bundle-chroot-builder and clr-bundles directories are on the system.

The builder configuration file can be found in:
	/usr/share/defaults/bundle-chroot-builder/
By default, the builder will use the config in here, but can be overridden by
one placed in /etc/bundle-chroot-builder/, or specified with -c/--config.

Running The Builder
===================
To build version 10 chroots:
	./bundle-chroot-builder.py 10

To build version 10 chroots using a custom configuration file
	./bundle-chroot-builder -c /path/to/builder.conf 10
